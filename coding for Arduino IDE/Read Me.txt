The coding file "SERIAL COM" should be uploaded to an Arduino UNO via the software: Arduino IDE




The coding file "SKETCH_MAY20A" should be uploaded to an IoT Module (NodeMCU ESP8266 Lua V.1)




Rules:

1. First connect the IoT Module to desktop, and then upload the code.

2. After uploading the code for IoT Module, then connect the Arduino board to dekstop. Upload the code for Arduino UNO.

3. Check the 'Serial Monitor' option in ARDUINO IDE software to see if the codes or the devices are working properly or not.
